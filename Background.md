# Background

Housing affordability has become a central economic and social issue in the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), particularly for first-time homebuyers. Over the past several years, Halifax has experienced rapid population growth driven by interprovincial migration, international immigration, and increased student retention. At the same time, housing supply has struggled to keep pace with demand, contributing to rising home prices and rental costs. For first-time buyers, this environment has made the decision of when to purchase a home increasingly complex and financially consequential.

This decision matters because housing is typically the largest financial commitment an individual makes. Buying too early may expose a first-time buyer to high mortgage interest rates and affordability stress, while waiting too long risks further price appreciation that could place homeownership permanently out of reach. In HRM specifically, rising rents also impose a cost on those who delay purchasing, reducing their ability to save for a down payment. As a result, the decision to buy now or wait has long-term implications for financial stability, wealth accumulation, and quality of life.

The difficulty of this decision is amplified by uncertainty in key market conditions. Mortgage interest rates have risen significantly following efforts by the Bank of Canada to control inflation, increasing monthly mortgage payments and reducing borrowing capacity. While future rate cuts are widely anticipated, their timing and magnitude remain uncertain. Simultaneously, housing prices in HRM have shown resilience due to persistent demand and limited supply, making it unclear whether waiting will meaningfully improve affordability. These opposing forces—potentially lower rates versus potentially higher prices—create a challenging tradeoff for first-time buyers.

Several stakeholders are affected by this decision. First-time homebuyers are directly impacted through affordability, financial risk, and housing security. Renters and landlords are indirectly affected as rental demand fluctuates with changes in buyer behavior. Mortgage lenders and financial institutions have a stake in borrowing volumes and default risk. Real estate developers and builders are influenced by expectations about future demand and pricing. Municipal planners and policymakers also play a role, as zoning decisions, densification policies, and infrastructure investments affect long-term housing supply in HRM.

Currently, the prevailing approach for many first-time buyers is to delay purchasing in anticipation of interest rate reductions, while continuing to rent in a tight rental market. Meanwhile, municipal and provincial governments are pursuing long-term housing supply initiatives, such as densification incentives and accelerated permitting, though these measures take time to impact market conditions. As a result, individual buyers must make decisions in an environment where policy responses and market adjustments may not align with their personal timelines.

This project uses a decision intelligence framework to help clarify this complex choice. Rather than attempting to predict housing prices or interest rates precisely, the analysis focuses on understanding how key variables—such as affordability, demand, supply, and buyer confidence—interact over time. A causal loop diagram is used to illustrate reinforcing and balancing feedback mechanisms within the housing system, providing insight into why market conditions behave as they do. This systems-based perspective aims to support a more informed and resilient decision for first-time homebuyers in Halifax.
